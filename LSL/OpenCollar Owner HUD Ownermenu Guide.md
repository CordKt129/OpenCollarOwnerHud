## How to set up the OpenCollar OwnersHud Owner Menu.

You need some basic edit skills, but I have tried to make it as easy as possible to set this up.

1. You can wear the Hud (but it should not be locked in position), in your inventory, find the Hud you are wearing, right click the Hud and select edit.
2. Select the Content Tab on the edit menu
3. Give it a few moments to fill it's list, then scroll down to `OpenCollarHUD - Ownermenu` (should be the second last script just above rezzer.
4. Double click it or select open to open up the script, It should then look something like below.
5. All you do is change the parts in between the `" "` for both the `Button` and corresponding `cmd` some basic ideas are included. You can change or add your own comments against buttons by adding `// <Your own comments>`.
6. Once finished select <kbd>save</kbd> to save the script back to the HUD. It should see your new commands straight away.
7. if not you may have to select edit again and reset scripts. This will remove any subs stored in the HUD, but a minor task to rescan them again.

The menu system is designed to work with any command you would normally type in chat to access the collar you just leave off the sub/pet/etc's channel number and prefix IE instead to typing `/1xrnadu`, you just name a button as Nadu and add `"nadu"` to the corresponding button. This command can then be sent to `1` or all your subs at once.
