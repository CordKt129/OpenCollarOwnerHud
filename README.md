OpenCollar Owner HUD
--------------------

The Owner HUD provides an alternative style to operate the collar. It is compatible with OpenCollar 3.9 API versions. Issues with corrupted assets could be resolved for 3.940 versions and greater. As HUDs in general are a matter of personal preference, our goal is to keep this gadget in balance to community dynamics and overall feedback.
